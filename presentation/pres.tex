  \begin{frame}{Next steps}
    Upstream!
    \begin{itemize}
      \item XDP: switch-statement
      \item Rx/Tx: drivers
      \item Rx: {\tt XDP\_ATTTACH} and {\tt bpf\_xsk\_redirect}
      \item libbpf AF\_XDP support
      \item Tx: multiple Tx sockets per UMEM
      \item selftest, samples
    \end{itemize}    
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Future work}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item hugepage support, less fill ring traffic ({\tt
      get\_user\_pages})
    \item fd.io/VPP work vectors (i\$, explicit batching in function calls)
    \item ``XDP first'' drivers 
    \item collaborate/share code with RDMA (e.g. {\tt
      get\_user\_pages})
    \item Type-writer model (currently not planned)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  % TODO Talk about built-in plus copy for tcpdump based on AF_XDP?

  \begin{frame}{TL;DR}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rx 15.1 to 39.3 Mpps (260\%)
  \item Tx 25.3 to 68.0 Mpps (269\%)
  \item Busy poll() promising
  \item DPDK still faster for ``notouch'', but AF\_XDP on par when data is touched
  \item drivers need to change when skb is not the only consumer
  \end{itemize}
